## üçï tokenomics basics

<br>


### supply

<br>

* if the circulating supply is low while the total and max are high: red flag as the value of your coins will get diluted away (more coins created will put pressure on the price
* the monetary policy in crypto dictates whether a coin is inflationary or deflationary and by how much, as well as the overall consensus mechanism for the project


##### concepts

* **Circulating supply:** How many tokens are in existence (in the market)?
* **Max supply:** How many tokens will there be in total? 
* **Total suppply:** all tokens already issued minus the ones that were burned/locked.


##### questions


1. Based on supply alone, will this token hold or increase it‚Äôs value? Or will that value be inflated away?
2. How many tokens exist today?
3. How many will ever exist? (supply cap)
4. Is the issuance rate fixed or variable? If variable, what are the factors that determine (and can influence) issuance rate?
5. How was supply initially allocated among investors, community, core team, etc? Are there any group(s) with a significant holding that could drive material selling pressure upon vesting?
6. What is the vesting schedule for the largest holders?

### demand

<br>

##### questions


1. Why would someone hold this token?
2. Is there an opportunity to earn additional return by yield farming?
3. Are earnings/fees generated from the protocol distributed back to token holders?
4. Does any rebasing take place as the protocol inflates?
5. Is there a lockup in program in place?
6. If there is a lockup program in place, what is the incremental value of rewards and what are the requirements to earn those rewards?
7. What % of total tokens outstanding are locked up?
8. How much selling pressure is generated upon lockup expiration?
9. Are there other non-monetary benefits to staking + locking up tokens (besides increasing voting power)?

### liquidity and valuation

<br>


##### concepts


* **Fully diluted valuation:** How will the supply change over time? 
* **Market cap**: Current Price * circulating supply
* **Fully Dilute:** Market cap: Price * max supply.

### distribution

<br>


* good distribution design is when no single person or group holds a large amount of the coin, instead, it‚Äôs distributed among many individuals.

##### concepts

* **Holders**: Who has the supply? WHEN can they sell?
* **DAOs/project research**: What are their policies for changing?


##### questions

* how are the initial tokens distributed? 
* There are roughly 2 ways:
   - pre minted: in this case, VCs and Insiders could dump their tokens and cause a price crash. 
Vesting means when they're allowed to sell the tokens. You want to make sure that the early backers are INCENTIVIZED with the protocol long-term.

        1. The team distributes tokens to itself.
        2.  Distribution to insiders such as the team and venture capitalists

  - fair launch: 100% fair. Everyone has equal access.

### concerns

<br>

* The tokens were inflationary without enough utility.
* Concentration of tokens by VCs & whales led to retail getting dumped on.
* Understanding the market cap would show that it's impossible.

### what drives the demand 

<br>

* Utility (gas, fun, adoption)
* Value Accrual (xStaking, governance)
* The Memes and Narratives
